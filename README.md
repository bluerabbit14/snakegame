project- snake game using java language
    We all have played that Iconic Snake Game in our childhood. My project follows the same game rules. Length of the Snake increases as it eats more apples and game ends when it eats itself or cross game board border. The Board dimensions are fixed but drag it to change. Apples appears at random location on board.
